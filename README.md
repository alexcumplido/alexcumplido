### Hello there!

I like bringing projects to live with an explorer mindset.

A year ago I started pivoting into web development, after self learnign HTML, CSS and JS I enrolled at the ITAcademy taking the React path. Currently I am migrating my projects to TypeScript and implementing accessibility standards. Problem-solving in team scenarios is what I enjoy.

Looking forward to being part of a team where contribute with my skillset while growing as a team member and developer.
